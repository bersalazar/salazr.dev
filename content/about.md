I'm currently part of [Adaptive Consulting](https://weareadaptive.com) where I work as a site reliability engineer, building tools to manage cloud infrastructure and apps.

All of us have [multiple personas](https://sive.rs/dw) based on our interests.
Mine are:

- [Making music and collaborating with friends](https://linktr.ee/berniroco).

- Travelling all around Catalunya (and sometimes Europe) with my wife,
looking for [rock climbing](https://thecrag.com/climber/bersalazar) crags.

- Watching films, reading books, and [writing about it](https://sinkingstone.com).

- And of course, [writing code](https://github.com/bersalazar).

<!--In this blog, I put on the software engineer hat and write about stuff I learn and implement.-->


My hope is to, some day, make all of these interests work together and create something unique.
