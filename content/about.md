I've spent the last 15 years working with software, either as a consultant or as a developer.

Currently, I'm a site reliability engineer at [Adaptive Consulting](https://weareadaptive.com), mainly focusing on building internal tools to manage cloud infrastructure and ops.

I enjoy [making music](https://lintr.ee/berniroco) at home, [rock climbing](https://www.thecrag.com/climber/bersalazar) all over Europe and [reading](https://goodreads.com/bersalazar).

write about all the different personas I develop:

be open, honest.

- software engineer, as bersalazar

- musician, as berni roco

- climber, as bernieclimbs

- philosopher, as sinkingstone. Reference to Goodreads, Letterboxd and sinkingstone.com

Mention I believe we have multiple personas.

Describe each with minimalistic, yet powerful detail.

Consider additional Now page to list current projects and interests: 

- book I'm reading

- tv show I'm watching

- music I'm making

- albums I've recently added

- climbing projects

- home software projects

Mention my writing persona is less anxious and more outgoing than my spoken persona.

Mention I'm not very original, but more contemplative and interpretative.

That's why I take reference from Robert Heaton. I mimic, blend and come up with something of my own.
